# capstone_project_cyclist_bike
This is a case study from Google Data Analytic Certification program for a fictional bike-share company (Cyclistic) in order to help them attract more riders. In this case study, I identified the trends and differences of casual users and members Cyclistic bike usages to understand why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect Cyclistic marketing tactics.
